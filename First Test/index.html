                        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology. </p>
                    <p>   AngularJS is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. HTML is a great declarative language for static documents. It does not contain much in the way of creating applications, and as a result building web applications is an exercise in what do I have to do to trick the browser into doing what I want?</p>
                    <p>The impedance mismatch between dynamic applications and static documents is often solved with:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dd>a library</dd>
                        <dt>a collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. </dt>
                        <dd>frameworks</dd>
                        <dt>a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something app specific.</dt>
                    </dl>

                        <p class="version-text">Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2" by the team, but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up</p>
                        <h1 class="version-heading">Version 2</h1>
                        <p class="version-text">Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22â€“23. October 2014.[9][10] The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers.[11] On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.[12] Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,[13] and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.[14] The final version was released on September 14, 2016.</p>
                        <h1 class="version-heading">Version 4</h1>
                        <p class="version-text">On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0.[15] The final version was released on March 23, 2017.[16] Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.[17]

                            Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.
